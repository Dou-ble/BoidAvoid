The goal of this game is to avoid getting hit by the boids. You can shoot the boids to destroy them. The Boids will spawn endlessly in waves. After getting hit by Boids 10 times you lose.

Move with WASD. Left click to shoot the gun.

The Boids algorithm is modified so that the Boids think that the player is the center of the mass. The Boids will try moving towards the player, as well as keep a distance from each other and match velocity with other Boids. This leads to some unpredictable movement.
